Welcome to the android-templates wiki!

The purpose of our android-templates repository is to quickly start a new project with all the **must-have** requirements. Other **nice-to-have** features need to be considered as an optional setting when starting a new project.

Planning to add a new feature? Ask yourself the following questions to define if it's a **must-have** requirement:

- Is the feature frequently used in other projects? (Ex: Glide, Retrofit, ...)
- Does the feature increase productivity of the team? (Ex: Firebase, Proxyman, ...)

Do _both_ apply to your feature? If not, we will define it as a **nice-to-have** feature:

- Ex: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) simplifies writing code for UI, but is not frequently used (yet)
- Ex: [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/) is frequently used, but does not provide any other value unless JSON animations are needed
